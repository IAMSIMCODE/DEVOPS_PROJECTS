    <p>
        Git is a distrubuted version control system.
        It allows developers make their own copy of the main repository, 
        hence it is refered to as a distributed version control system.
        it essentially solved the problem of sharing source code efficiently and keeping track of changes made to source code.</p>

        <p>I Made this changes in dev branch and am going to merge it to the main branch</p>
